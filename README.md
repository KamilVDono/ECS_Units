# ECS_Units
# This project is dead because every Unity update keeps introducing changes that result in editor crashes (and invalids some tests).
# I was using preview packages and the alpha version of Unity so this problem was expected but not at scale.

#  I started new ECS project for thesis (a little changed thesis title) about Finite State Machine in ECS (node-based designing environment and code generation) [ECS_FSM](https://github.com/KamilVDono/ECS_FSM)

## TL;DR
My engineering thesis project. Main goal is to implement GOAP (goal oriented action planning) in Unit with DOTS. My secondary goal is to create RTS game with at least 1000 autonomous units on 2D grid map (400x400). 
Game uses [Unity](https://unity.com) and [DOTS](https://unity.com/dots).
