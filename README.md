# ECS_Units
## TL;DR
My engineering thesis project. Main goal is to implement GOAP (goal oriented action planning) in Unit with DOTS. My secondary goal is to create RTS game with at least 1000 autonomous units on 2D grid map (400x400). 
Game uses [Unity](https://unity.com) and [DOTS](https://unity.com/dots).
